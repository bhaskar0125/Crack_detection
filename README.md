# Concrete Crack Detection

This project is a Python-based application for detecting cracks in concrete using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Copilot customization instructions.

## Next Steps
- Add your dataset and model training code.
- Implement image preprocessing and crack detection logic.
